  <h1>Vertical Rhythm</h1>
  <h2>2 - See what's going on</h2>
  <p>next up we add some lines to our page to see how elements should be lined up<p>
  <p>These lines are 18px (our line height) apart and are for illustrative purposes only. It means we can quickly see if the elements of the page are keeping in rhythm</p>
  <a href="style.scss"><small>style.scss</small></a>
  <pre>
    body{
      background-image: url(data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhBQASAIAAAN3d3f///yH5BAAAAAAALAAAAAAFABIAAAIKjI+py+0PF5izAAA7);
    }
  </pre>

  <p>Straight away we can see that although our lines of text are 18px apart they don't align with our guide lines at all.</p>
  <p>
    The first line of this page is a P tag with our new line-height and font-size. The reason it is not aligning is the default browser style applies
    <br>
    margins to all block-level elements.
  </p>
  <p>
    For Chrome, the margin above and below the P tag is set to 1em. This is our font-size value (12px).
    <br>
    for each line of text to line up with our guide lines we would want those margins to be equal to our line-height (18px or 1.5em).
  <p>

  <h3>the basic unit</h3>
  <p>our line-height of 18px is in-fact our basic unit of rhythm<p>
  <p>Vertical Rhythm provides us with a function to easily insert it into our css<p>
  <pre>
    rhythm(1)
  </pre>
  <p>which compiles to 1.5em</p>
