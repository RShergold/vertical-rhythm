  <h1>Vertical Rhythm</h1>
  <h2>3 - Add rhythms to margins</h2>

  <p>the first thing we are going to do is remove all of the default margins and padding from all block level elements we are going to use</p>
  <a href="style.scss"><small>style.scss</small></a>
  <pre>
    body, div, h1, h2, h3, p, pre {
      margin: 0;
      padding: 0;
    }
  </pre>

  <h3>adding the rhythm</h3>
  <p>Then we add rhythm to each block element</p>
  <a href="style.scss"><small>style.scss</small></a>
  <pre>
    body {
      margin: rhythm(1);
    }

    p {
      margin-bottom: rhythm(1);
    }
  </pre>
  <p>which compiles to</p>
  <a href="style.css"><small>style.css</small></a>
  <pre>
    body {
      margin: 1.5em;
    }

    p {
      margin-bottom: 1.5em;
    }
  </pre>

  <h3>Nicely aligned</h3>
  <p>
    every line now fits within the bounds of our 18px guide lines. The only elements that have a margin are BODY and P.
    <br>
    Those margins take up exactly one line.
  <p>
  <p>
    However, our headers seem a bit wrong. They need some spacing... What's going on there?
  </p>
  <p>
    The headers have the line height set in
  </p>
  <pre>
    html {
      line-height: 1.5em
    }
  </pre>
  <p>
    as this line-height is calculated in relation to the font-size of HTML it results in a line-height of 18px.
    <br>
    that's exactly what we need to fit it nicely in our guide lines but is not the correct line height for the headers as
    <br>
    they are a larger font size.
