  <h1>Vertical Rhythm</h1>
  <h2>9 - End of part 1</h2>

  <p>
    That ends part one - an introduction to basic vertical rhythm
  </p>
  <p>
    Although we covered the basic concepts, there are <a href="http://compass-style.org/reference/compass/typography/vertical_rhythm/">
    more mixins and functions</a> available in Compass you can check out.
  </p>
  <p>
    Next up we are going to cover how we (at Hatch) structure our margins and paddings (our layout rules) to avoid issues with collapsing margins and some Internet Explorer 'hasLayout' issues.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally we will merge the two parts of this document to describe how we effectively use Vertical Rhythm with our layout rules.
