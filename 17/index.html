  <h2>7 - End of part II</h2>

  <p>
    That ends part two - an overview of the Hatch layout rules
  </p>

    The layout rules are there to not only deal with collapsing margins on modern browsers but also minimise issues
    when it comes to older versions of ie and their hasLayout issues.
  </p>
  <p>
    by having clear rules we also gain the added benefit of collaborating developers being able to instantly understand
    where and how the vertical spacing between elements is defined.
  <p>

    across.
