  <h1>Vertical Rhythm</h1>
  <h2>1 - Setting up Vertical Rhythm</h2>
  <p>the first thing we do is import vertical rhythm from compass<p>
  <p>
    As most browsers default to a font-size of 16px we are going to change ours to something noticeably different.
    <br>
    We are going with a font-size of 12px and line-height of 18px.
    <br>
    finally, to actually apply these values we call the establish-baseline mixin
  <p>
  <a href="style.scss"><small>style.scss</small></a>
  <pre>
    @import "compass/typography/vertical_rhythm";

    $base-font-size: 12px;
    $base-line-height: 18px;

    @include establish-baseline;
  </pre>

  <h3>Compiled scss</h3>
  <p>Our style.scss file compiles into the following</p>
  <a href="style.css"><small>style.css</small></a>
  <pre>
    * html {
      font-size: 75%;
    }

    html {
      font-size: 12px;
      line-height: 1.5em;
    }
  </pre>
  <p>
    The first 3 lines are aimed at Internet Explorer 6 and older.
    <br>
    Here we set the base font size as a percentage of the default (16px).
    <br>
    75% of 16 = 12
  <p>
  <p>Our next line sets the base font size in pixels to our chosen size. (12px)<p>
  <p>
    Finally the base line height is set.
    <br>
    This is done in em's which is relative to the font size.
    <br>
    1em is now 12px (our font size) so to set our line height to 18px we set line height to 1.5em
    <br>
    12 * 1.5 = 18
