  <h1>Layout Rules</h1>
  <h2>5 - When to use the third rule</h2>

  <p>If we cast our minds back to the original explination of collapsing margins..</p>
  <p>"When two block level elements <b>of the same block formatting context</b> adjoin vertically"</p>
  <p>
    an explanation of block formatting contexts <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#block-formatting">
    can be found here</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    so the reason our margins collapse in the previous example is because the frame (div3) and the last child element (div1)
    both have the same block formatting context.
    <br>
    The key to understanding the third rule is to realise that this will not always be the case
  </p>

  <h3>Grids</h3>
  <p>A large part of the layout of a webpage will be defined by a grid system.</p>
  <p>
    Whether you are using a ready made grid system <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid">Like bootstrap</a>
    or are creating your own, they generally rely on floating DIV elements to create the columns.<br>
    If you then place standard block elements inside that floated DIV they will be a different block formatting context
  </p>
  <p>
    lets try that out by adding float to div3 from the previous example
  </p>
  <pre>
    .div3 {
      float:left;
      width: 100%;
    }
  </pre>
  <div class="div3">
    <div class="div1"></div>
    <div class="div2"></div>
    <div class="div2"></div>
    <div class="div1"></div>
  </div>

  <p>
    et voil√†
    <br>
    we can now see the bottom margin from the last child element and the bottom margin from our container (div3)
  </p>
  <p>
    So for these circumstances (the first level inside the grid) we don't have to do anything and our margins will render as expected
    <br>
    What about the next level down?
